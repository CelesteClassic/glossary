      <div id="spikeclip">spike clip</div><hr>
      <div class="subcontent">
        there are two ways in which spikes can be clipped:
        <br><br>
        1) spikes don't kill you if you're moving in the direction they face, and gravity isn't applied when you're directly above the ground.
        <br><br>
        if you <b>land on the ground with an upward velocity</b>, you can <b>clip through up-facing spikes</b> until you're eventually lifted off of the ground (giving a <a href="#boost">boost</a>).
        <br><br>
        <img src="img/spikeclip1.gif" width="96" height="96">
        <br><br>
        this clip can be done <b>without spikes</b>, and is useful for quickly restoring dashes, or getting a <a href="#boost">boost</a>.
        <br><br>
        2) in the early frames of a dash, the distance you travel in 1 frame can be larger than a spike's hitbox. if a spike <b>doesn't have a solid block behind it</b>, e.g., the ceiling in 2500m, you can completely dash over it.
        <br><br>

      <br>

      <div id="spikejump">spike jump</div><hr>
      <div class="subcontent">
        if your <b>x-coordinate has odd parity</b> (see <a href="#parity">parity</a>), you can get close enough to <b>left-facing spikes</b> to safely walljump off of solid blocks behind them.
        <br><br>
        <img src="img/spikejump.gif" width="96" height="96">
      </div>
      <br>

      <div id="emptydash">empty dash</div><hr>
      <div class="subcontent">
        if you dash <b>without providing directional input</b>, you will perform a <b>shorter forward dash</b> than if you were holding forward. most of the time, this can be used to change your x-coordinate's <a href="#parity">parity</a>.
        <br><br>
        <img src="img/emptydash.gif" width="144" height="96">
        <br><br>
        <b>note:</b> empty dashes are <b>not possible</b> in the new release's port of celeste classic. a full-length forward dash will be performed instead.
      </div>
      <br>

      <div id="softdash">soft dash</div><hr>
      <div class="subcontent">
        if you are <b>next to the room's boundary and moving toward it</b> such that you would exceed the boundary on the next frame, <b>dashing away from the boundary during this frame</b> will slow the startup of the dash's horizontal speed.
        <br><br>

      <div id="boost">boost</div><hr>
      <div class="subcontent">
        boosts refer to the <b>additional height gained</b> from clipping a solid block with an <b>upward velocity</b> (restoring both your dash and <a href="#graceframes">grace frames</a>), and performing a grace jump while <b>above the ground</b>.
        <br><br>

      <div id="cloudboost">cloud boost</div><hr>
      <div class="subcontent">
        if you pass through a cloud such that there's a <b>frame of you directly above the cloud</b>, both your dash and <a href="#graceframes">grace frames</a> are restored whilst maintaining your velocity.
        <br><br>

      <br>

      <div id="cornerjump">corner jump</div><hr>
      <div class="subcontent">
        corner jumps refer to one of two walljump setups:
        <br><br>
        1) with a well-positioned walljump or diagonal dash, you can get around a solid block's corner with <b>enough height to walljump</b> off of that block.
        <br><br>
        <img src="img/cornerjump1.gif" width="96" height="96">
        <br><br>
        2) because spikes don't kill you if you're moving in the direction they face, if you <b>steer in the direction a spike's facing</b> at the right moment, you can get close enough to safely walljump off of a solid block's corner.
        <br><br>
        <img src="img/cornerjump2.gif" width="96" height="96">
      </div>
      <br>

      <div id="landingclip">landing clip</div><hr>
      <div class="subcontent">
        upon colliding with a solid block, your velocity and subpixels in the collision direction <b>will be set to 0</b>. if you fall such that there's a frame of you <b>directly above the ground without colliding with it</b>, you can maintain your velocity and subpixels by leaving the ground on the next frame.
        <br><br>
        <img src="img/landingclip.gif" width="192" height="96">
        <br><br>
        landing clips allow for subpixel manipulation, and restoring dashes without coming to a full vertical stop.
      </div>
      <br>

      <div id="gemskip">gemskip</div><hr>
      <div class="subcontent">
        gemskip refers to <b>exiting 2200m without collecting the dash power-up</b>. there are two ways of accomplishing this:
        <br><br>
        1) by <b>dashing on the same frame that you trigger the chest opening sequence</b>, the dash gets performed after the sequence is over, and both your dash and <a href="#graceframes">grace frames</a> are restored. you can then exit by immediately grace jumping, and dashing upward when high enough.
        <br><br>
        <img src="img/gemskip1.gif" width="120" height="120">
        <br><br>
        2) walljumping in the ditch next to the chest with a <b>y-coordinate between 93.35 and 93.40</b> lets you clip the ground to get a <a href="#boost">boost</a>. you can then exit by grace jumping at the boost's peak, and dashing upward when high enough. this route is typically denoted <b>chestskip</b>.
        <br><br>

      <br>

      <div id="graceframes">grace frames</div><hr>
      <div class="subcontent">
        when leaving the ground by any means other than a jump, e.g., running off a ledge or dashing off, the game gives you a <b>6 frame grace period</b> to input a jump as if you were still on the ground. resulting mid-air jumps are denoted <b>grace jumps</b>.
        <br><br>
        <img src="img/graceframes.gif" width="360" height="120">

      <br>

      <div id="parity">parity</div><hr>
      <div class="subcontent">
        parity refers to a state of being <b>even or odd</b>, and whether your position has even or odd-numbered coordinates determines whether certain options, like <a href="#spikejump">spike jumps</a>, are possible. below is an overview on <b>controlling your x-coordinate's parity</b>:
        <br><br>
        you <b>spawn with an even x-coordinate</b>, and regular horizontal movement like walking and drifting mid-air <b>can't change your x-coordinate's parity</b>.
        <br><br>
        horizontally aligning yourself with the room's boundary or a solid block <b>will make your x-coordinate odd</b>.
        <br><br>
        <img src="img/parity.gif" width="148" height="74">
        <br><br>
        depending on subpixels, <a href="#emptydash">empty dashes</a> <b>usually switch your x-coordinate's parity</b>, and regular forward dashes <b>usually preserve its parity</b>.
        <br><br>
        depending on subpixels, notably as a result of time spent wall sliding, time spent mid-air, time spent moving into the room's boundary, and many other factors, walljumps and diagonal dashes <b>may or may not switch your x-coordinate's parity</b>.
